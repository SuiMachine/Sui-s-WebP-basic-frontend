Sui's WebP basic frontend
============
This is a basic frontend for Google's WebP conversion programs. Don't expect anything fancy - the main reason for its creation was to have a pipeline for converting an image sequence to a nice WebP animation, without having to use gif on the way.

To use it, you'll need libwebp, which you can find here - [https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html](https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/releases/webp/index.html).

You'll have to place it in: <Program Folder>\libwebp. So that the path looks like this <Program Folder>\libwebp\bin\.
